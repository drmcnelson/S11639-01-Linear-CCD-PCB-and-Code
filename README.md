# S11639-01-Linear-CCD-PCB-and-Code
This repo provides electronics, firmware and host software for the Hamamatsu S11639-01, a linear CCD sensor that has very low dark noise at 0.2mV and a very large dynamic range at 10,0000. 
The electrical design is implemented as a two board set, sensor and controller.
The sensor board has a socket for the sensor and a low noise front-end with 16 bit ADC and SPI interface.
The controller board hosts a Teensy 4.0 or 3.2 and has a matching ribbon connector to interface to the sensor board.
We separate the sensor and controller for mechanical stability, for example in a sensitive instrument such as a spectrometer.
The firmware provides high end functionality including clocked, triggered, and gated operation.

In the firmware, codes that are specific to the sensor are in a separate c++ file and header.  The "sketch file" implements a command interface and calls the sensor code to do the "work" of collecting frames in various operating modes.  The codes throughout, use the standard Arduino libraries plus a small number of optional register level enhancements for the i.MX RT MCU that provide faster and more constant interrupt latency and SPI transfers with less overhead.

The following image shows the circuit side of the sensor board with the high precision low noise differential front end (dual opamp lower right, adjacent to the video out pin from the sensor) interfaced to a differential 16bit 1MSPS ADC, and logic level converters (center) for the external digital interface.  The sensor is socketed on the reverse side. 
SPI and logic signals are brought to the double row header at the top edge of the board (ribbon cable compatible).
The external logic level is set by VDD supplied by the controller card.
Power for the sensor and other circuit elements is 5V and supplied by a separate connector.
The small jumper top center near the double row header, selects whether the CNVST pin on the ADC is connected to the TRG signal from the sensor or to the host processor.
(The firmware at present assumes the CNVST pin is connected to the MCU.)
The jumper and header (lower left) selects the internal 4.096V reference or provides a connector for an external reference.
The output from the analog section is available on the three pin header center bottom.
The trim pot should be set to 1.6V for sensors meeting the "typical" spec with output from 0.6V to 2.6V, there is a test point next to the trim pot labeled Voffset where the offset voltage can be measured.

The control board hosts a Teensy 4.  The double row header across the top matches that on the sensor board.  The two boards should be connected by a ribbon cable that can be a few inches in length, and by a two wire cable for power, between the connectors labeled "5V" upper left on this board and upper left on the sensor board.  (The power cable will cross the ribbon cable when the boards are positioned correctly and joined by a ribbon cable.)
The single row headers provides access to the digital interface signals and provides additional pins to the right for a trigger input, sync and busy ouputs and spare digital I/O pin.   The double row header on the let provides access to the onboard analog digital converters and any of these can be used for digitial I/O.  While all of these have diode protection, users should be cognizant that the Teensy is not 5V tolerant.

Running the supplied sketch (see the Firmware directory), the controller appears as a serial port or com port with a human readable command interface.  There is a help command that produces a listing of all of the available commands.  The device can collect (a) single frames, (b) clocked series of frames, (c) triggered single frames, (d) triggered sets of clocked frames (i.e. triggered kinetic series), and (e) gated frames.  There are commands to set the sense (hi/low) of the trigger input and each of the digital outputs, and to set whether the sync output is asserted at the beginning of each frame or series.  There is a "hold off" that can be used to triggered an external device and then wait for a fixed time before collecting a frame.  Busy is asserted whenever the device is active and until data has been transferred to the host computer.   A Python utility and class library and a C language utility and library provide two options for working with the device and integrating into equipment and experiments 

The following shows a spectrometer built with the S11639-0 and a fluorescent lamp spectrum collected through an optical fiber and 200um slit and single 100ms exposure, with the fluorescent ceiling lamp at a distance of about 2 meters from the end of the fiber.  (At a 10ms exposure the background is 0.5mV as listed in the datasheet for the sensor.) The sensor board is mounted in a frame that allows adjustment to position the sensor on the focus.  The control board is mounted outside on the light tight cover, for easy access to the pins without disturibing the sensor board, and connected to the sensor board via a 5 inch long ribbon cable and power (twisted red and black wires). Notice that all of the optical mounts are 3-d printed.  The base plate was purchased on Amazon, the sma905 port, slit and lenses on ebay and the transmission grating from Thorlabs.
